        <p class="center-text">Think of the internet as a massive, bustling city, filled with endless roads, vehicles, and intersections connecting every neighborhood and building. Each road represents a network connection, and every vehicle represents the data packets carrying information from one place to another.

Now, in this digital city, there are rules of the road that determine how data travels safely and efficiently.
That rulebook is called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) — it tells data how to move between a web browser and a web server.</p>
        
        <p class="center-text">Imagine driving on a public highway with no toll booths, cameras, or police — anyone could watch, intercept, or even mess with your car as you drive by.
That’s what happens when data travels over HTTP (port 80).
Everything you send — your messages, login info, or browsing activity — is in plain text, visible to anyone with the right tools. It’s convenient but risky, especially on public Wi-Fi.</p>

        <figure><img src="assets/images/intercept .gif" alt="Car intercepting other car"></figure>
        <p>Now picture another road — wider, protected, and guarded — where every vehicle is enclosed in bulletproof glass, and only verified drivers can enter.
This is HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which uses port 443.
Here, your data is wrapped in encryption using SSL/TLS certificates, turning your messages into unreadable code that only the intended destination can decipher. Even if someone intercepts the packets, all they see is gibberish.
Port 443 secures the journey by encrypting the lanes. 
This secure route prevents:

🕵️ Eavesdropping (no one can read your data)

🧩 Tampering (no one can alter it mid-route)

🪪 Impersonation (your browser confirms the site’s identity)</p>

        <p class="center-text">So, when you see that little 🔒 lock icon in your browser’s address bar, it means you’re driving down the secure road — your journey across the internet city is protected from prying eyes.</p>
